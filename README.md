Repository made from chapter 3 in Getting MEAN.  In chapter4, the typo is on page 92 Listing 4.5 at the very top where the code says "doctype 5".  It should say "doctype html". The book's indentation was extremely difficult to follow and it did not match up with that of the ch04 src from GitHub.

Chapter05:
Everything went pretty smoothly for the most part.  I did have a hard figuring out how to set up the mongodb environment.  I also had to use both gitbash and command prompt, which was annoying and confusing at times.  The mongo shell was pretty cool.  Changing my dbURI to equal process.env.MONGOLAB_URI did not really work for me so I just left the mmongoDB connection string.  I also could not find the connection confirmation in the heroku logs, but my app connects to mongo and works locally and on the heroku url.
